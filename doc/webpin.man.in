.SH "PROXY SUPPORT"
Starting with version 0.7, webpin is able to use an HTTP proxy to send out
its requests to the Package Search web service.

Note that as of this version, only the Basic Authentication is supported,
and only with HTTP proxies (not HTTPS).

To use a proxy, either pass the --proxy=hostname:port option to the
webpin command line, or add the following line in the [Network] section
of the configuration file:
.nf
    [Network]
    proxy = hostname:port
.fi

To also enable authentication, pass the --proxy-auth=username:password
option to the webpin command line, or add the following line in the
[Network] section of the configuration file:
.nf
    [Network]
    proxy_auth = username:password
.fi

Note that the password must be specified in clear text, and that specifying
proxy_auth or --proxy-auth has no influence unless passing --proxy (or setting
proxy in the configuration) as well.

Webpin also honors the
.B http_proxy
environment variable, that must have the format
.B host:port
or
.B http://host:port
.

.SH "RPM DATABASE INTERACTION"
When passing the --rpm option, webpin compares search results with your
local RPM database (or a database of a chroot, using the --rpm-root option)
and shows whether the search results are installed on your local system
or not, as well as comparing the versions (only versions, not releases
nor epoch as those values are not provided by the Package Search service).
.br
Note that those options and features are only available when the package
rpm-python is installed on your system.

.SH "ZYPPER SUPPORT"
When the following criteria are met, webpin enables support for zypper and
shows whether the package repositories that contain search matches are
currently available in your zypper configuration (or not, or disabled):
.nf
- /usr/bin/zypper is available
- webpin is running as root (unfortunately, this is currently required to run `zypper sl`)
- the option --zypper has been passed to webpin on the command line, or
  the option `zypper = yes` is specified in [Zypper] section of the the configuration file
.fi

.SH "SMART SUPPORT"
Similarily to the zypper option, webpin supports querying the list of
channels configured in smart and displays whether package repositories
that contain search matches are currently avalable in your channel
list (or not, or disabled).

Smart support is only available when:
.nf
- smart is installed
- the option --smart has been passed to webpin on the command line, or
  the option `smart = yes` is specified in the [Smart] section of the configuration file
.fi

the specified query.
